            <h1>Colon Cancer Prevention: Evidence-Based Steps to Lower Your Risk</h1>
            <p class="article-date">February 9, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">

            <p>Colorectal cancer is one of the few cancers for which prevention, not just early detection, is a realistic goal. Screening colonoscopy can find and remove precancerous polyps before they become malignant, and modifiable lifestyle factors account for a substantial portion of colorectal cancer risk. A 2018 analysis published in the International Journal of Cancer estimated that roughly 50% of colorectal cancer cases could be attributed to modifiable risk factors.</p>

            <p>This does not mean that all colorectal cancer is preventable. Genetics, age, and factors beyond individual control play significant roles. But the evidence is clear that specific actions can meaningfully reduce risk.</p>

            <h2>Screening: The Most Effective Prevention</h2>
            <p>Screening is technically early detection, not prevention, but colonoscopy blurs the line because polyps removed during screening would have eventually become cancers. The National Polyp Study, a landmark trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated that colonoscopic polypectomy reduced colorectal cancer incidence by 76 to 90 percent compared to reference populations.</p>

            <p>Getting screened on schedule, starting at age 45 for average-risk adults, is the single most impactful step you can take. If you are behind on screening or have never been screened, scheduling a colonoscopy or a stool-based test should be a priority.</p>

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <h3>Fiber</h3>
            <p>High dietary fiber intake is associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk. A meta-analysis in the BMJ including data from 25 prospective studies found that each 10-gram increase in daily fiber intake was associated with a 10% reduction in colorectal cancer risk. Good sources of fiber include whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruit. The recommended daily fiber intake for adults is 25 to 30 grams, though most Americans consume about half that amount.</p>

            <h3>Red and Processed Meat</h3>
            <p>In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a division of the World Health Organization, classified processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen for colorectal cancer and red meat as a Group 2A probable carcinogen. Each 50-gram daily serving of processed meat (about two slices of bacon or one hot dog) was associated with an 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer. For red meat, each 100-gram daily serving was associated with a 17% increased risk.</p>

            <p>This does not mean you must eliminate red meat entirely. The risk is dose-dependent, and moderate consumption (one to two servings per week) appears to carry minimal additional risk. The greatest risk is associated with daily consumption and heavily processed products (bacon, sausage, deli meats, hot dogs).</p>

            <h3>Calcium and Dairy</h3>
            <p>Higher calcium intake, from both dairy and supplements, has been consistently associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. A pooled analysis of 10 cohort studies found that individuals consuming more than 700mg of calcium daily had a 25% lower risk compared to those consuming less than 500mg. The recommended daily intake of calcium is 1,000 to 1,200mg for most adults.</p>

            <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
            <p>Regular physical activity is one of the most well-established protective factors for colorectal cancer, particularly colon cancer (the association with rectal cancer is less consistent). A 2016 meta-analysis in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that the most physically active individuals had a 20% lower risk of colon cancer compared to the least active.</p>

            <p>The mechanism likely involves multiple pathways: reduced insulin and insulin-like growth factor levels, decreased inflammation, improved immune function, and faster transit of stool through the colon (reducing contact time between potential carcinogens and the colon wall). Current guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.</p>

            <h2>Body Weight</h2>
            <p>Obesity is a well-established risk factor for colorectal cancer. A BMI above 30 is associated with a 30 to 40% increased risk compared to a normal BMI. Excess abdominal fat in particular, measured by waist circumference, appears to be the strongest predictor of risk. The link between obesity and colorectal cancer is thought to involve chronic inflammation, elevated insulin levels, and changes in hormones such as adiponectin and leptin that influence cell growth.</p>

            <h2>Alcohol and Tobacco</h2>
            <p>Both alcohol and tobacco are independent risk factors for colorectal cancer. For alcohol, the risk increases in a dose-dependent manner. Consuming three or more drinks per day is associated with a 40% increased risk. Even moderate consumption (one to two drinks daily) is associated with a modest increase. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends limiting alcohol to no more than two drinks per day for men and one for women.</p>

            <p>Smoking is associated with a 20% increased risk of colorectal cancer, with the risk increasing with the number of pack-years. Former smokers retain an elevated risk for at least 10 years after quitting.</p>

            <h2>Aspirin and NSAIDs</h2>
            <p>Long-term, regular use of aspirin has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer risk by approximately 20 to 30% in multiple large studies and randomized trials. The USPSTF has recommended low-dose aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention in certain adults, though this recommendation has evolved. As of 2022, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin for adults over 60 who have not previously been taking it, citing bleeding risks. For adults aged 40 to 59 with elevated cardiovascular risk, the decision should be individualized.</p>

            <p>Aspirin is not without risks. Regular use increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. It should not be started for cancer prevention without discussing the risks and benefits with your doctor.</p>

            <h2>Know Your Family History</h2>
            <p>A first-degree relative with colorectal cancer approximately doubles your risk. If the relative was diagnosed before age 50, or if multiple relatives are affected, the risk increases further. Knowing your family history allows your doctor to determine whether you need earlier or more frequent screening and whether genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes (such as Lynch syndrome) is warranted.</p>
