            <h1>Types of Colon Polyps: Which Ones Are Dangerous?</h1>
            <p class="article-date">February 9, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">

            <p>When your gastroenterologist tells you that polyps were found during your colonoscopy, the natural first question is: are they dangerous? The answer depends almost entirely on the type of polyp. Most colon polyps are benign and will never become cancer. Others are precancerous and, if left in place for years, have the potential to develop into colorectal cancer. Understanding the distinction is important because it determines your follow-up surveillance schedule and long-term cancer risk.</p>

            <h2>How Polyps Are Classified</h2>
            <p>Polyps removed during colonoscopy are sent to a pathology laboratory for microscopic examination. The pathologist examines the cellular structure and classifies the polyp by type, size, and degree of abnormality. This report, usually available within one to two weeks, is what determines your next steps.</p>

            <p>Polyps fall into several broad categories, each with different implications.</p>

            <h2>Adenomatous Polyps (Adenomas)</h2>
            <p>Adenomas are the most clinically important polyp type because they are the precursors to most colorectal cancers. Approximately 70% of all polyps removed during colonoscopy are adenomas. The adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, in which a normal cell progresses through increasingly abnormal stages before becoming cancerous, is estimated to take 10 to 15 years on average. This long time window is what makes colonoscopy screening so effective: removing adenomas interrupts the progression.</p>

            <p>Adenomas are further classified by their growth pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tubular adenomas</strong> are the most common type, accounting for roughly 80% of adenomas. They have a tube-like glandular structure. Small tubular adenomas (under 10mm) have a low risk of harboring cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Villous adenomas</strong> have a finger-like projection pattern and carry the highest cancer risk among adenoma subtypes. Approximately 15 to 25% of villous adenomas larger than 2 centimeters contain cancerous cells at the time of removal.</li>
                <li><strong>Tubulovillous adenomas</strong> have features of both tubular and villous patterns. Their cancer risk falls between the other two types.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The risk of an adenoma progressing to cancer depends on three main factors: size (larger is riskier), histology (villous features are riskier), and the degree of dysplasia (high-grade dysplasia is riskier than low-grade). An adenoma that is larger than 10mm, has villous features, or shows high-grade dysplasia is called an "advanced adenoma" and warrants closer surveillance.</p>

            <h2>Sessile Serrated Polyps</h2>
            <p>Sessile serrated polyps (formerly called sessile serrated adenomas) are a more recently recognized category that has transformed how gastroenterologists think about colon cancer pathways. These flat, often subtle polyps account for roughly 15 to 25% of colorectal cancers through what is called the "serrated pathway," a cancer development route distinct from the classic adenoma sequence.</p>

            <p>Sessile serrated polyps are more common in the right (proximal) colon and tend to be flat, making them harder to detect during colonoscopy. They have a saw-tooth microscopic pattern and, when they develop dysplasia, can progress to cancer more rapidly than traditional adenomas. Their flat shape and tendency to hide under mucus folds contribute to the phenomenon of "interval cancers," cancers that appear between screening colonoscopies.</p>

            <p>If your pathology report identifies a sessile serrated polyp, particularly one larger than 10mm or with dysplasia, your gastroenterologist will typically recommend a surveillance colonoscopy in three years.</p>

            <h2>Hyperplastic Polyps</h2>
            <p>Hyperplastic polyps are the most common type of non-neoplastic (non-precancerous) polyp. They are typically small (under 5mm), found in the rectum or sigmoid colon (the lower left portion), and carry essentially no cancer risk. If your colonoscopy finds only small hyperplastic polyps in the rectum or sigmoid, your follow-up schedule is typically the same as if no polyps were found: repeat colonoscopy in 10 years.</p>

            <p>However, large hyperplastic polyps (over 10mm) found in the right colon may be reclassified as sessile serrated polyps upon pathologic review, so location and size matter even for this generally benign category.</p>

            <h2>Inflammatory Polyps</h2>
            <p>These polyps are not truly neoplastic. They form in response to chronic inflammation, most commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). Inflammatory polyps themselves do not become cancerous, but patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at elevated risk for colorectal cancer through a separate mechanism related to chronic inflammation.</p>

            <h2>What Your Pathology Report Means for Follow-Up</h2>
            <p>The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer provides evidence-based surveillance guidelines based on polyp findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No polyps or only small hyperplastic polyps in the rectum/sigmoid:</strong> Repeat colonoscopy in 10 years.</li>
                <li><strong>1-2 small tubular adenomas (under 10mm):</strong> Repeat in 7 to 10 years.</li>
                <li><strong>3-4 small tubular adenomas:</strong> Repeat in 3 to 5 years.</li>
                <li><strong>5-10 adenomas:</strong> Repeat in 3 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Any advanced adenoma</strong> (10mm or larger, villous features, or high-grade dysplasia): Repeat in 3 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Sessile serrated polyp under 10mm without dysplasia:</strong> Repeat in 5 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Sessile serrated polyp 10mm or larger, or with dysplasia:</strong> Repeat in 3 years.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These intervals represent a balance between catching new or missed polyps early and avoiding the costs and risks of more frequent procedures. Your gastroenterologist may adjust these intervals based on the quality of the bowel preparation, your family history, and other individual factors.</p>

            <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
            <p>Finding polyps during a colonoscopy is common and usually not cause for alarm. The most important information is the pathology result, which tells you and your doctor exactly what was found and how to proceed. If you have questions about your polyp pathology report, ask your gastroenterologist to walk you through it. Understanding your findings helps you stay on the right surveillance schedule and catch any future polyps before they become a problem.</p>
