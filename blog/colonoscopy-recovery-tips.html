            <h1>After Your Colonoscopy: Recovery Tips and What to Expect</h1>
            <p class="article-date">February 9, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">

            <p>The colonoscopy itself is typically the easy part. Most patients are sedated during the procedure and have little or no memory of it. The recovery period, while generally straightforward, does come with some temporary effects from the sedation and the procedure itself that are worth understanding in advance.</p>

            <h2>Immediately After the Procedure</h2>
            <p>You will spend 30 to 60 minutes in a recovery area as the sedation wears off. During this time, nurses will monitor your vital signs and ensure you are alert enough to be discharged. Most colonoscopies use moderate sedation (sometimes called "twilight sedation") with medications such as midazolam and fentanyl, or deep sedation with propofol. Propofol wears off more quickly, and patients sedated with propofol typically feel clear-headed sooner.</p>

            <p>Your gastroenterologist will usually speak with you briefly in the recovery area to share preliminary findings: whether polyps were found and removed, whether the exam was complete, and when your next colonoscopy should be. If biopsies were taken or polyps removed, final pathology results will take one to two weeks.</p>

            <p>One common post-procedure experience is bloating and gas. During the colonoscopy, air or carbon dioxide is used to inflate the colon for better visualization. Some of this gas remains afterward. Walking around helps move the gas through, and most patients find that the bloating resolves within a few hours. Do not hold back; passing gas is expected and encouraged.</p>

            <h2>Sedation Recovery</h2>
            <p>The sedation medications affect your judgment, reaction time, and memory for the remainder of the day. Regardless of how clearheaded you feel, you should not drive, operate heavy machinery, make important financial or legal decisions, or consume alcohol for the rest of the day. You are required to have someone drive you home from the procedure.</p>

            <p>It is normal to feel drowsy, slightly dizzy, or mentally foggy for several hours after sedation. Some patients notice minor gaps in memory from the hours around the procedure, which is a known effect of midazolam. These effects resolve completely by the next day for the vast majority of patients.</p>

            <h2>Eating and Drinking After</h2>
            <p>Most doctors recommend starting with light, easily digestible foods after your colonoscopy. Your colon has just been emptied and may be slightly irritated, especially if polyps were removed. Good options for the first 24 hours include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soup and broth</li>
                <li>Crackers, toast, or plain rice</li>
                <li>Scrambled eggs</li>
                <li>Bananas and applesauce</li>
                <li>Cooked vegetables</li>
                <li>Plain chicken or fish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Avoid high-fiber foods, raw vegetables, nuts, seeds, popcorn, and spicy or fried foods for the first 24 to 48 hours. Also avoid alcohol on the day of the procedure, as it can interact with residual sedation medications.</p>

            <p>Drink plenty of fluids to rehydrate after the bowel preparation. Water, clear broth, sports drinks, and herbal tea are all good choices. Some patients notice that their appetite is reduced for a day or two after the procedure, which is normal.</p>

            <h2>If Polyps Were Removed</h2>
            <p>Polyp removal (polypectomy) involves cutting or cauterizing tissue from the colon wall. While it is performed during the colonoscopy itself and you will not feel it under sedation, the removal site needs time to heal. After polypectomy, additional precautions may apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, and other blood-thinning medications for the period your doctor specifies (typically 5 to 7 days) to reduce bleeding risk.</li>
                <li>Avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting for 24 to 48 hours, or longer if large polyps were removed.</li>
                <li>Some spotting of blood in the stool is normal for the first day or two after polypectomy. Small amounts of bright red blood are usually not concerning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Normal Post-Procedure Symptoms</h2>
            <p>The following are common and generally resolve within 24 to 48 hours:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bloating and cramping from retained gas</li>
                <li>Mild abdominal discomfort</li>
                <li>Drowsiness and fatigue from sedation</li>
                <li>A small amount of blood in the first bowel movement (if polyps were removed)</li>
                <li>Irregular bowel habits for one to three days as the colon returns to normal</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Warning Signs: When to Call Your Doctor</h2>
            <p>While serious complications from colonoscopy are rare (occurring in roughly 2 to 3 per 1,000 procedures), they can occur. Contact your doctor or go to the emergency department if you experience any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy rectal bleeding</strong> (more than a tablespoon of bright red blood, or continuous bleeding): This may indicate post-polypectomy hemorrhage, which occurs in about 1 to 2% of polypectomies. It can sometimes occur up to two weeks after the procedure.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe or worsening abdominal pain:</strong> Mild cramping is normal, but severe pain, especially if it worsens over time, could indicate perforation (a small tear in the colon wall). Perforation is rare (roughly 1 in 1,000 procedures) but requires immediate treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius):</strong> May indicate infection, which is very rare after colonoscopy but requires evaluation.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent nausea or vomiting:</strong> Could indicate a delayed reaction to sedation or, rarely, a bowel issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Inability to pass gas or have a bowel movement for more than 48 hours after the procedure, combined with abdominal distension:</strong> Could indicate a blockage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Returning to Normal</h2>
            <p>Most patients feel completely back to normal within 24 hours of the procedure. You can typically return to work the next day (or the same day for afternoon procedures if you were not heavily sedated). Light exercise can resume the day after, with a return to full activity within two to three days unless your doctor advises otherwise.</p>
